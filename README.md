# Lost but Found

This is a web app that displays the lost and found items of NYC's MTA system. 

## Purpose

I want to continue to practice my React.js and React Bootstrap/sass skills, but I also want to use this as an opportunity to learn and implement React Hooks and Redux on a manageable scale.

## Status

In progress.
